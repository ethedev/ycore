# Yam Protocol Multichain

# Introduction

With an ever evolving DeFi space, we are building and experimenting with new technologies, constantly emphasizing stability, security and decentralization. We trust the future of crypto and DeFi, and envision big role for layer 2 solutions on Ethereum. Currently we live on the Ethereum mainnet, however we see significant benefits from operating on different chains at the same time.

## What are L1 and L2?

### Layer 1

Layer 1 (L1) refers to the base blockchain, and is typically the name used to represent a main blockchain network protocol like Ethereum. The name is derived from its relation with Layer 2 scaling solutions such as state channels, rollups, nested blockchains, and plasma side chains. L2 connects to L1 to boost its scalability and transaction efficiency. L1 blockchains are often referred to as the parent or root chain.

### Layer 2

Layer 2 (L2) is a network or technology that operates on top of an underlying blockchain protocol L1 to improve scalability and efficiency. This category of solutions involves offloading a portion of the transactional weight of a blockchain protocol to an adjacent system architecture, which then performs the majority of the network operations and reports back to the main blockchain to finalize the results.

## Why go multichain?

Yam has always focused on security, stability and improvements, and moving forward into the future we see scalability is as much important. While users and workloads increases on Ethereum, we believe it is time to move forward and construct an upgraded governance model on multiple L2 network to exist and operate all in sync with one another, this will result in a wider reach and provide flexibility for token holders on many aspects, along with lower gas fees and extended accessibility to interact and build on other chains. Highlighting few key points benefits below.

### Yam Protocol L2 Benefits

- **Cross chain protocol governance**
- **Cheap gas fees**
- **Faster transactions**
- **Wider product and user reach**
- **Extended network participations, partnerships and possibilities**
- **More decentralization**
- **First of a kind**

# Overview

We are building and upgrading the very core layers of the protocol, the “Yam Protocol”, which will then give the public a wide range of options to build their ideas and applications on the top of.
